# Simulation Bridge

The **Simulation Bridge** is an open-source middleware solution designed to enable seamless and dynamic communication between Digital Twins (DT), Mock Physical Twins (MockPT), and their dedicated Simulator counterparts. It serves as a **modular**, **reusable**, and **bidirectional** bridge, supporting multiple protocols and interaction modes to ensure interoperability across diverse simulation environments.

Built around the concept of simulation, the bridge facilitates control, monitoring, and data exchange among the involved entities, providing a universal middleware solution that enhances flexibility and integration within simulation-based systems.
