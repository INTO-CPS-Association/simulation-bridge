simulation:
  request_id: abcdef12345              # Unique identifier for the simulation request
  client_id: dt                        # ID of the client making the request (e.g., Digital Twin)
  simulator: matlab                    # Specifies MATLAB as the simulation engine
  type: batch                         # Simulation type: 'batch' means a one-time execution, not continuous/streaming
  file: SimulationBatch.m              # Name of the MATLAB file to run for the simulation
  inputs:
    x_i: 10                          # Initial x-coordinate of the ball
    y_i: 9                           # Initial y-coordinate of the ball
    z_i: 0                           # Initial z-coordinate of the ball
    v_x: 1                           # Velocity along the x-axis
    v_y: 14                          # Velocity along the y-axis
    v_z: 3                           # Velocity along the z-axis
    t: 10                           # Duration of motion (time)
  outputs:
    x_f: Final x position             # Output field name for the final x-coordinate
    y_f: Final y position             # Output field name for the final y-coordinate
    z_f: Final z position             # Output field name for the final z-coordinate
